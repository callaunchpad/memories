              Welcome to the Memories project, a web app where users can upload
              pictures from their photo album and generate ambient sounds and
              songs from the imageâ€™s scenery and emotion. Our software uses
              pre-trained models such as Resnet and Soundnet and a multimodal
              architecture to deconstruct both images and audio.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              In between our work sessions where we build our training models,
              we also make sure to create some meaningful
              experiences together no matter where we are.
